## Problem Statement

PEW Retail Inc. Ltd. has subsidiaries across the globe, and they are selling products to various customers scattered across different geographies. They are looking to have a consolidated dashboard with the following requirements: 
1.How much Tax do they pay based on the various region they do business in? 2. Number of orders received by various product categories. 3. Who are their top five customers in consuming their products? 4. Order received by various regions to various product categories and products. S. All this data is restricted as per the region. For example, a business user who owns an Australian subsidiary is restricted only to see the Australian data. 6. Any changes or additions to the sales data should automatically get reflected to the Dashboard without any manual intervention.
